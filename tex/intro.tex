Bioinformatics is conceptualizing biology in terms of molecules and applying ``informatics techniques'' to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large scale \cite{bioinfo}.
The aims of bioinformatics are multiple.
Firstly, well-organized data allow researches to access existing information and to submit new entries as they are produced.
Secondly, it develops tool and resources useful for the analysis of these data.
The development of these tools requires a lot of knowledge in biology, informatic and also physics and mathematics.

In particular, this project will focus on the protein folding problem.
How protein folds is a vital process that can be useful for a lot of purposes, from bioengineering to the medical applications.
Understanding how proteins fold can help us to cure diseases like Alzheimer, in which proteins start to not fold correctly, treat virus infections and also projecting more efficient drugs \cite{PERM}. 

The aim of this project is to report the main results in the developing of the HP model for protein folding.
