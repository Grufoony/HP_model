Between the plethora of algorithms used to approximate the solution of the protein folding problem, one of the most promising is Reinforcement Learning.

\subsection{Basics of Reinforcement Learning}

RL is a kind of algorithm that is particularly effective when the program is able to interact with the system analyzed.
The main structure of a RL algorithm is that of an \emph{agent} which interacts with an \emph{environment} and on the base of its actions gets as feedback a \emph{reward} and the new state of the environment.
The goal of the model is to find the best \emph{policy} which is a function that returns the action that maximizes the reward at each state.

\subsubsection{Markov Decision Processes}

MDPs are at the core of RL algorithms, since they describe a discrete-time stochastic control process.
The name comes from the fact that they are an extension of the Markov chains, which are systems in which the evolution of a state depends only on the current state and not on its past.
