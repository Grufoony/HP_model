Proteins are large biomolecules formed by one or more chains of amino acids.
The genetic information contained in the DNA only specifies the sequence of these amino acids, the so-called \emph{primary structure} of the protein.
It has been experimentally observed that purified proteins, i.e. proteins purified away from other cellular components, tends to spontaneously refold after being completely unfolded \cite{ProteinFolding1990}.
Understanding why and how protein folds may be a vital task for biological researches.
In fact, in order to be biologically active, a protein must adopt specific folded three-dimensional structures.
