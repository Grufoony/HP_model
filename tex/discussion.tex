As we saw, protein folding is actually a hard task.
The application of PERM algorithm gave better results by incrementing the number of iteration, but required a lot of computational time, e.g. 5 hours for $10^8$ iterations of Fig. \ref{fig:18_2}.
Then, this approach is not sustainable because the result's uncertainty will grow up as the protein length increases.

Finally, a solution to the HP model should be searched into the Artificial Intelligence field.
In fact, brute force algorithm undergo the curse of dimensionality, being useful only for short proteins.
On the other hand, solutions based on deep reinforcement learning, and in general in the A.I. field, are more sustainable and give better results.
Two example of intelligences that are giving many good results are AlphaFold and AlphaFold2 by Google.
In particular, the second one reached a precision level comparable to the experimental one.
The future of this topic seems to be linked to research whose goal is to expand the protein databases underlying these intelligences.
